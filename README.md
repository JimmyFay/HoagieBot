# HoagieBot
HoagieBot is a TTRPG bot tailor made for my own use. It is coded in python 3 and runs on the Discord API and is intended to function on a discord channel. I am the sole creator and contributer to the code itself and the sound files in /music. It is tested and updated frequently as need be as it is used by me and my friends. Since this bot is so custom made, it will need to be adjusted to any other game desired, and as this code was meant for my friends I have removed all explicit or sensitive information such as discord user IDs and keys. However I still include the lore.py file in full as to demonstrate the possibilities of what the bot can provide. All creative content is my own intellectual property and meant solely as a way to have fun with my friends, the bot is only posted here as a way to showcase my skills.
