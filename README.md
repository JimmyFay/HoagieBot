# HoagieBot
HoagieBot is a TTRPG bot tailor made for my own use. It is coded in python 3 and runs on the Discord API and is intended to function on a discord channel. I am the sole creator and contributer to the code itself and all strictly creative content has been removed to protect my own intellectual property. It is tested and updated frequently as need be as it is used by me and my friends. Since this bot is so custom made, it will need to be adjusted to any other game desired, and as this code was meant for my friends I have removed all explicit or sensitive information such as discord user IDs and keys. The bot is meant solely as a way to have fun with my friends and is only posted here as a way to showcase my skills. 
## How it works:
Bot.py is meant to also have accompanying .bin files for each main gamestate (player stats, creatures, lore, etc) and a lore.py python file that contains all the lore entries hard coded into the file as arrays so that bot.py can use pickle to retrieve them from the correct .bin file. There should also be a folder for any sounds used in the bot. I have elected to exclude these files to protect my own creativity, and bot.py along with the sNSPlayer.py file which provides all the classes used in the bot, is the minimum you need to at least understand if not implement the project.
